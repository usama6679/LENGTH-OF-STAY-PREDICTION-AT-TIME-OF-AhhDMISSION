# LENGTH-OF-STAY-PREDICTION-AT-TIME-OF-AhhDMISSION
For this project, we have chosen to focus on hospital Length-Of-Stay (LOS), which is a very crucial aspect of determining the wait times and beds availability in the hospitals.  Length-Of-Stay (LOS) is defined as the period of time, expressed in days, between hospital admission time and discharge time.
